#+TITLE: Raytracer
* What are we building?
** A ray tracer!
*** Following the ray tracer challenge book: http://raytracerchallenge.com/
*** Implementing the Whitted raytracer algorithm - "An improved illumintation model for shaded displays"
*** Recursive Raytracing:
**** Cast a ray into the scene and figure out when it hits the surface of something
**** Cast a ray from that point toward each of the light sources the determine which lights illuminate that point
**** If the surface is reflective, cast a new ray in the direction of the reflection and recursively determine the color of that point
**** If the surface is transparent, do the same in the direction of the refraction
**** Combine all the colors to that point, the surface color, reflection and refraction.
